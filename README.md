# Credit-Fraud-detection-using-Autoencoder
Credit fraud detection using keras and Autoencoder in R.

The credit data set is downloaded from Kaggle and using that dataset I will cluster fradulent and non-fradulent cases.


## Plot for the differences in distribution of Fradulent and normal transactions

From the above plot we can see that distribution of all features for normal and __Fradulent__ transactions differ in a lot, except __Time__ variable.
